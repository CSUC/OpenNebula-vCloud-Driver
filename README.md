## Description

This addon gives Opennebula the posibility to manage resources in VMware vCloud infraestructures. 
It includes virtualization and monitoring drivers.

This driver is based on [vCenter Driver](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/blob/master/src/vmm_mad/remotes/vcenter/vcenter_driver.rb) and uses a
modified version of [ruby_vcloud_sdk](https://github.com/vchs/ruby_vcloud_sdk).
